# Customer Segmentation in R

This repository contains code for customer segmentation using R. Customer segmentation is an essential task in marketing and customer relationship management (CRM), as it allows businesses to better understand their customers' behavior and preferences. By dividing customers into meaningful segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to different customer groups, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on certain characteristics, such as demographics, behavior, or preferences. In this project, we use the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Data Exploration

Before diving into customer segmentation, we perform data exploration to gain insights into the dataset. We load the customer data and conduct summary statistics on various attributes.

## Customer Gender Visualization

We visualize the distribution of customer gender using bar plots and pie charts to better understand the gender composition of the customer dataset.

## Analysis of Customer Age

We analyze customer age by creating a box plot, histogram, and density plot to examine the age distribution within the dataset.

## Analysis of Annual Income

We analyze annual income by creating a histogram and density plot to examine the income distribution among customers.

## Analysis of Spending Score

We analyze the spending score of customers by creating a box plot and histogram to understand the distribution of spending scores.

## K-Means Clustering

We apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into groups based on age, annual income, and spending score. We determine the optimal number of clusters using various methods.

## Average Silhouette Method

We use the average silhouette method to evaluate the quality of clustering results and choose the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation.

## Gap Statistic Model

We also use the gap statistic model to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering.

## Visualizing Clustering Results

Finally, we visualize the clustering results by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and create scatter plots that display customer clusters.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own customer segmentation project.

For more details, you can refer to the [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/parvbhargava/Customer-Segmentation-in-R/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb) containing the code and additional comments.

**Note**: Ensure you have the necessary R packages installed before running the code, as specified in the script.
